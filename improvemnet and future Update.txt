1. API Key Management
 Use environment variables to store the API key instead of hardcoding it.

2. Error Handling
 Add user-friendly error messages for issues like invalid city names or no internet connection.
 Ensure the weather card hides when there's an error.

3. Input Validation
 Validate the input to ensure it's not empty or invalid before making the API call.

4. Display Loading State
 Add a loading spinner or message while fetching data.

5. Code Modularity
 Refactor the code into smaller reusable functions:
 fetchWeatherData()
 updateUI()
 validateInput()
 handleError()

6. Accessibility Enhancements
 Add descriptive alt text for weather icons.
 Use ARIA roles and focus management to make the app accessible for keyboard users.
7. Performance Optimization
 Minimize DOM manipulations by only updating necessary elements.

8. Caching and Reuse
 Implement a caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls for the same city.

9. Use HTTPS
 Ensure all API calls use https:// for security.

10. Code Cleanliness
 Cache DOM elements in variables to reduce repeated getElementById calls.

Future Updates
 Add support for showing additional weather information (e.g., forecast for upcoming days).
 Allow the app to auto-detect the user's location and display weather information for it.
 Provide a history of searched cities for quick access
